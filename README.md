The combination of a high demand for activities and an unreliable booking system led to this. Run the program, and you should have booked a slot within one minute of it being possible. Might need to `pip install requests`. Modify the `credentials` and `activity_name` variables (`"username"` is your email address). To find the `activity_name` for your activity, check the `activities.txt` for a list of activity names.
